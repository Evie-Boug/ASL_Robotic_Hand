## Project Overview

Inspired by the "Addam's Family," Rubie Luo, Evie Bouganim, Khushi Patel, and Meghan Dang created <em> Thing </em>, a robotic hand capable of signing American Sign Language (ASL) letters. <em> Thing </em> is custom designed using a combination of 3D printed parts and the LEGO EV3 Mindstorms kits. Each finger is individually actuated with 3 joints and 1 DOF. The robot operates usin 6 motors, a touch sensor, and a gyroscope. 

## Operation

<em> Thing </em> reads input from a file downloaded to the LEGO EV3 brick, filters for profanity, and signs each letter. After all of the words have been signed, the hand will pause, waiting for the heart-shaped cap on the touch sensor to be pressed. Once given a "high five," the robot will "wave" goodbye, and then terminate the program.
